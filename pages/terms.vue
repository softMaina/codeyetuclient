          If a dispute arises out of or relates to the Terms, either party may not commence any Tribunal or Court
          proceedings in relation to the dispute, unless the following clauses have been complied with (except where
          urgent interlocutory relief is sought).
          14.2. Notice:
          A party to the Terms claiming a dispute ('Dispute') has arisen under the Terms, must give written notice to

          On receipt of that notice ('Notice') by that other party, the parties to the Terms ('Parties') must:
          (a) Within 30 days of the Notice endeavour in good faith to resolve the Dispute expeditiously by negotiation
          or such other means upon which they may mutually agree;
          (b) If for any reason whatsoever, 14 days after the date of the Notice, the Dispute has not been resolved, the
          Parties must either agree upon selection of a mediator or request that an appropriate mediator be appointed by
          the President of the Chartered Institute of Arbitration or his or her nominee;

          venue of the mediation and without limiting the foregoing undertake to pay any amounts requested by the
          mediator as a pre-condition to the mediation commencing. The Parties must each pay their own costs associated
          with the mediation;
          (d) The mediation will be held in The Chartered Institute of Arbitration Kenya offices or any other appointed

          negotiations for the purpose of applicable laws of evidence.
          14.5. Termination of Mediation:
          If 30 have elapsed after the start of a mediation of the Dispute and the Dispute has not been resolved, either
